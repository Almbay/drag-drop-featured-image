## Description

Drag & Drop Featured Image is a plugin made to save you time when setting a featured image. What it does is simple, it replaces the default "Set featured image" metabox with a new one containing a Plupload drop area just like the one found in the media uploader.

Since it uses the default Wordpress functions it will compress all sizes just as the regular upload method would and it also respects any custom image sizes.

In WordPress versions lower than 3.5 the page will reload after a successful image upload in order to show the new image. This has been fixed in more recent versions of WordPress, but cannot be implemented properly in older versions.

If you want to showcase testimonials on your website I highly recommend you to download the [Testionials Widget plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/testimonials-widget/ "View plugin") by [Michael Cannon](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/comprock/ "Visit profile").
