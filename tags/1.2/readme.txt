Drag & Drop Featured Image is a plugin that replaces the default "Set featured image" metabox with a drop zone for faster uploads.

== Description ==

Drag & Drop Featured Image is a plugin made to save you time when setting a featured image. What it does is simple, it replaces the default "Set featured image" metabox with a new one containing a Plupload drop area just like the one found in the media uploader.

Since it uses the default Wordpress functions it will compress all sizes just as the regular upload method would and it also respects any custom image sizes.

The plugin comes with a custom options panel which can be found under Appearance => "D&D Featured image". From here you can toggle support for custom post types on/off with easy as well as modify the default file size limit.

== Installation ==

To perform a manual install, do the following:

1. Upload the 'drag-and-featured' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin through the Appearance => D&D Featured Image options panel
